          <p>Hi there! My name is Diego, and I'm an Electronics Engineer. I hold a master's degree in Electrical Engineering and I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Control Theory.</p>
          <p>I'm extremely passionate about science, particularly mathematics, and I proudly consider myself a geek. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a deep interest in technology and enjoy exploring its advancements.</p>
          <p>Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid animal lover, both for dogs and cats. I find immense joy in their companionship and care. When I'm not immersed in the world of academia, you'll often find me engrossed in sports, especially football (soccer).</p>
          <p>I also have a great affinity for board games, especially when I can gather with friends and enjoy a good beer alongside the gameplay.</p>
          <p>I must mention that the person alongside me in the photo (the one you can see in the main page) is my wonderful wife, Cecilia, who is a constant source of inspiration in my life.</p>
